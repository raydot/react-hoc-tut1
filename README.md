Follwing Robin Weiruch's article on HOC in React.  https://www.robinwieruch.de/gentle-introduction-higher-order-components/

The precursor to this tutorial on React conditional rendering is located elsewhere in my Repos:
https://github.com/raydot/react-conditional-rendering

Also, the tutorial comes with a punchline:  [The author](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) is leading up to using the [Recompose library](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) to augment your HOCs.  But the Recompose Library [author](https://github.com/acdlite) has invented [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to solve all of the problems of Recompose.  So Hooks it is!
